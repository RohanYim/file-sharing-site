# Requirements
File Management (25 Points):
Users should not be able to see any files until they enter a username and log in (4 points)
Remember that users.txt should be stored in a secure location on your filesystem. That is, you should not be able to type any URL into your browser and see the raw users.txt file!
Users can see a list of all files they have uploaded (4 points)
Users can open files they have previously uploaded (5 points)
Note: Users should be able to open not only plain text files but also other file formats: images, spreadsheets, etc.
Users can upload files (4 points)
Note: Like users.txt, uploaded files should be stored in a secure location on your filesystem. That is, do not keep your uploads directory underneath a directory served by Apache!
Users can delete files. If a file is "deleted", it should actually be removed from the filesystem (4 points)
The directory structure is hidden. Users should not be able to access or view files by manipulating a URL. (2 points)
Users can log out (2 points)
Note: If using session variables, you must actually log out the user by destroying their session; i.e., don't just redirect them to the login screen.
